## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Typescript 
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Motion](https://motion.dev/) - Animations library 


### What I learned

- Practiced using Typescript 
I learned how to work with typescript for type safety while I was working on this project.
- Practiced using the useReducer hook. 
I learned how to use the useReducer hook for managing multiple states, instead of using multiple useState hooks.
- Explored an animation library (Motion)
I used the motion library to add little animations to my project. 
- Explored Shadcn 
I learnt about shadcn and what it's difficult UIs while I was building this project. I also used the card component to build the opening page of the app.
- And others
I practiced storing data in local storage while working on this project. I also reinforced my knowledge on adding, removing and filtering data from an object while I was creating this Todo list app.
